","body":"The Mojo Executor provides a way to to execute other Mojos (plugins) within a Maven plugin, allowing you to easily create Maven plugins that are composed of other plugins.\r\n\r\nNews\r\n====\r\n\r\n25 Aug 2013 &mdash; Mojo Executor 2.1.0 released with support for Maven 3.1.\r\n\r\nDownloads\r\n=========\r\n\r\nYou can download the jars, source, and javadocs from Maven central:\r\n\r\nhttp://repo2.maven.org/maven2/org/twdata/maven/mojo-executor/\r\n\r\nExample Usage\r\n=============\r\n\r\nMojoExecutor defines a number of builder methods that are intended to be imported statically:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\nimport static org.twdata.maven.mojoexecutor.MojoExecutor.*\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is how you would execute the \"copy-dependencies\" goal of the Maven Dependency Plugin programmatically:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\nexecuteMojo(\r\n    plugin(\r\n        groupId(\"org.apache.maven.plugins\"),\r\n        artifactId(\"maven-dependency-plugin\"),\r\n        version(\"2.0\")\r\n    ),\r\n    goal(\"copy-dependencies\"),\r\n    configuration(\r\n        element(name(\"outputDirectory\"), \"${project.build.directory}/foo\")\r\n    ),\r\n    executionEnvironment(\r\n        project,\r\n        session,\r\n        pluginManager\r\n    )\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe project, session, and pluginManager variables should be injected via the normal Mojo injection:\r\n\r\n``` java\r\n/**\r\n * The project currently being build.\r\n *\r\n * @parameter expression=\"${project}\"\r\n * @required\r\n * @readonly\r\n */\r\nprivate MavenProject mavenProject;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * The current Maven session.\r\n *\r\n * @parameter expression=\"${session}\"\r\n * @required\r\n * @readonly\r\n */\r\nprivate MavenSession mavenSession;\r\n\r\n/**\r\n * The Maven BuildPluginManager component.\r\n *\r\n * @component\r\n * @required\r\n */\r\nprivate BuildPluginManager pluginManager;\r\n```\r\n\r\nYou might need to add other annotations to your Mojo class, depending on the needs of your plugin. Annotations declared by Mojos that you execute are _not_ automatically inherited by your enclosing Mojo.\r\n\r\nFor example, if you are using the `maven-dependency-plugin`, as in this example, you will need to add `@requiresDependencyResolution <scope>` to your class annotations to ensure that Maven resolves the project dependencies before invoking your plugin.\r\n\r\nSee the [Mojo API Specification][mojo-api] for details on available annotations. Look at the included [example plugin](mojo-executor-maven-plugin/) for an example of use.\r\n\r\nMaven Dependency\r\n================\r\n\r\nAdd this to your pom.xml:\r\n\r\n``` xml\r\n<dependencies>\r\n    <dependency>\r\n        <groupId>org.twdata.maven</groupId>\r\n        <artifactId>mojo-executor</artifactId>\r\n        <version>2.1</version>\r\n    </dependency>\r\n</dependencies>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are a few versions available, and the best one to use will depend on the version(s) of Maven you need to support:\r\n\r\n  - 1.0.1 &mdash; Supports Maven 2.x only\r\n  - 1.5   &mdash; Supports both Maven 2.x and Maven 3.x\r\n  - 2.0.x &mdash; Supports Maven 3.0.x only\r\n  - 2.1.x &mdash; Supports Maven 3.0.x and 3.1.x\r\n\r\nLicense\r\n=======\r\n\r\nCopyright 2008-2013 Don Brown\r\n\r\nLicensed under the Apache License, Version 2.0 (the \"License\"); you may not use this file except in compliance with the License.
